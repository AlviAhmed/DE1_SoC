*Status:* Completed 
*Type:* COE838 Lab


* Objective

  The purpose of this lab is to develop a hardware prototype in VHDL for the Cyclone V using Quartus II and QSys.

  This is done to learn more about the HPS/FPGA design flow in SoC design by using the provided DE1-SoC development board.

  Also by using ARM DS-5 and a serial terminal, FPGA hardware will be controlled through embedded C programs running on a Yocto Linux

  operating system. 

  To test the success of this lab, a custom word will be displayed on
  both the development board's seven segment display as well as print
  statements in the terminal.

* HPS/FPGA communication
  The DE1-SoC has 2 components that will be the focus of this lab, the FPGA and the Hard Processor System (HPS).

  For the communication between the 2 components there are different types, FPGA-to-HPS bridge (f2h), HPS-to-FPGA
  bridge (h2f) and the light weight HPS-to-FPGA bridge (lwh2f). The
  lwh2f will be focused on in this lab.   

  The various FPGA and HPS communication types can be seen in the top
  portion of this bus and bridge block diagram of the development
  board.

* Qsys 
  In general the design flow of this lab is portayed in the image
  below

  As can be seen Qsys plays a big part in this lab, it used generate the
  necessary HPS headers, a .tcl script for the HPS pin assignments and
  the necessary VHDL code for the SoC design.  

  It does this by using the
  inputted IP cores (i.e. various peripherals like a 7 segment display)
  as well allowing the user to set the connections between the HPS and
  IP blocks as seen in the image below.

* Results 

  The lab was a success, the system was able
  to produce the results and the leds lit up in the correct sequence as
  seen in the image below.
